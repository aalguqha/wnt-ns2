 *		Description: NearestPosition class is derived from Position class. This class
 *						 represents the localisation algorithm presented in [2]. The node
 *						 selects a subset of three references to estimate its position.
 *						 The selected references have the minimum measured distance to the
 *						 node (i.e. the closest three references to the node).
