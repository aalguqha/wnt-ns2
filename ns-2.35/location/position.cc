 *		Description: Position class represents the general multilateration method [1]
 *						 to estimate the node position. This method uses all of the
 * 					 available references, does not distinguish between beacons and
 *						 references, does not weigh the references used and performs
 *						 the estimation only once. This class is the base class for any
 *						 localization algorithms that will be implemented.
